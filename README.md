## Predicting the renewable energy % based on historical weather data

Project Codegreen estimates the optimal time point, which fulfills the renewable energy requirements. 
For example, when a user asks for the start time for 2-hour computation in Germany with 30% renewable energy, Codegreen provides the optimal time of day for the computation. 
The most important factor to predict the renewable energy percentage is the weather.
The sub-task here is predicting the renewable energy percentage of total energy production with the help of historical weather data.
